# Deals
The problem here is how to convert deal data into monthly revenues and visualise them so that a business understanding is given about revenue coverage along the time dimension. Bokeh was chosen mainly because of its hover capability.

Note: no real data was used in this repository

## Basic data
- For each deal we have TCV (Total Contract Value)
- The duration of the contract (in months)
- Yearly discount (20%)
